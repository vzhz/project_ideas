# project_ideas
Written in someone-should-make this form, as the ideas come to me. Inspired my some brave souls from my academic life, who kept a public, running list.


#### Reminders for commit-chasers
One of my goals is to commit at least two times every day in order to make sure I'm getting my head into a project and applying what I'm learning. Maybe you have similiar goals too. I would like to make a plug-in that reminds you, in your terminal or editor, how many commits you have made that day and how close you are to your goal. I could also allow the user to specify a project they want to make sustained progress on and have a message that nudges you to work on that project if you are doing otherwise, but that's later down the road.
