# project_ideas
Written in someone-should-make this form, as the ideas come to me. Inspired my some brave souls from my academic life, who kept a public, running list.


#### Mapping of harassment (or other events)
I do a lot of walking and biking in different areas of my city and have noticed that uncomfortable situations arise in some areas far often than others. After realizing that two-dangerous-feeling events had occurred within a block of each other and over a short time period, I had the idea to make a map of where harassment had occurred and see what trends arise, perhaps informing my safety decisions. I believe this could be done with Google APIs, since they already track my location and allow markers to be added to a map using your location.


#### Tool to integrate Uber & Lyft ride requests
I have noticed several ride-share drivers switching between apps, as they drive for more than one to boost their chances of having riders. I am sure neither platform would be pleased with this, but making a tool that integrates the requests from the two and alerts drivers of changes between app use would be a boon for them and may increase the safety of their driving.

#### Reminders for commit-chasers
One of my goals is to commit at least two times every day in order to make sure I'm getting my head into a project and applying what I'm learning. Maybe you have similiar goals too. I would like to make a plug-in that reminds you, in your terminal or editor, how many commits you have made that day and how close you are to your goal. I could also allow the user to specify a project they want to make sustained progress on and have a message that nudges you to work on that project if you are doing otherwise, but that's later down the road.

#### Erase Chris
I have been recieving unwanted messages from one person through a variety of platforms over the course of the last decade. Although there is no real threat, having him pop up on another platform and try to contact me every year or so is distracting and stressful, and I realized recently that it would be enough for me to regain some sense of control over his ability to contact me - I don't want to see his name again. Everyone experiences situations like this differently, so this will not be a far reaching "fix", but for me it would be enough to make an extension that would simply erase his name from my browser. Here's to taking charge.

#### Mood tracking
I have been using a variety of apps to help me identify the factors that influence mood swings. I would like data from these apps to be brought into one place so I can more easily look for trends in the data. Many of these apps allow export and for the rest there is webscraping! Idea came from @pjf's personal tracking efforts.
